# Task Description
Analyze the codes and justifications from following every Role submission and decide which reflect **consensus** and which show **divergence**.

Multiple role-based annotators each provided a list of codes with corresponding justifications for the same target text.
• Target Text:
"[Target Text]"

• Role submissions:
"[codes and justifications]"

# Requirements
## Categorisation rules
**Do not** include role names, job titles, or organizational references in the code label.
✅ **Agreed**  
• Select codes that are **semantically similar** and **appear** in two or more roles.
• Merge **near-synonymous codes** into one unified label with a single combined justification.
• **Keep at most 3** Agreed codes, ranked by the number of supporting roles.

⚠ **Disagreement**  
• Select codes that **closely align with the target text** yet still **diverge in meaning, viewpoint, or granularity**.
• **Briefly state why each code differs** (e.g., different emphasis, abstraction level mismatch, conflicting interpretation).
• **Keep at most 3** disagreed codes, prioritizing those that **remain textually grounded** yet **illustrate meaningful divergence**, rather than the most extreme differences.

## Justification requirement
• Every code must include **direct textual definition ** from the Target Text to **support or justify** the interpretation.
• You must quote one **full sentence** or **a key phrase (1–8 words)** directly from the Target Text, enclosing it in **square brackets** [] (e.g., [The interface encourages user trust.]).
• The quotation should be **integrated into the reasoning**, explaining **how it supports an Agreed interpretation** or **motivates a Disagreed one**.
• **Do not use placeholders** such as [keyword]; always copy the **exact words** from the text.
• Optionally, you may add a **brief analytical explanation** (e.g., focus difference,” “abstraction mismatch,” “alternative causal inference”) to clarify the **nature of agreement or divergence**.
🔒 **Total output ≤ 800 tokens**
