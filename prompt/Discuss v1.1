**You are a coder and participating in a three-role discussion for text coding**.

Target Text (fixed for the session)
-----------------------------------
"[Target Text]"   # pre-numbered; quote lines as [Words or Sentence]

Disagreement Code now in focus
------------------------------
"[code and justification]"

**Roles must speak one at a time, each following the rules below**.
• **Directly quote** from the Target Text — either **a full sentence** or **a key phrase (1–8 words)**.
• Enclose every quotation in **square brackets** [ ] so reviewers can verify it (e.g., [The interface encourages user trust.]).
• **Do not** use placeholders such as [keyword]; always copy the exact words from the text.
• **No external knowledge** — base all reasoning solely on the provided materials.

<discuss_round>
<round 1>
# Introduce
Please state your claim based on your role’s perspective and positionality statement, and provide a short explanation for your decision:
It is only your initial claim. In later rounds, you may confirm or revise this decision based on definition, reasoning, and other participants’ claims.

# Task Description
Should this disagree code be retained in the final data annotation codebook?

# Output Format

Output strictly in JSON

{
  "Initial Claim": "✅ Yes, the code "[code]" should be retained." Or "❌ No, the code "[code]" should not be retained.",
  "Explanation": "why choose the position."
}

<round 2>
# Introduce
Please provide a real, verifiable, factual definition based on your role’s perspective and positionality statement, and to support or challenge the initial claim and explanation from Round 1.  
This round is about supplying information, not making a new claim.

# Task Description
You must provide a real, verifiable definition from three complementary perspectives:

• **Literature-based definition**: You must provide a real, verifiable academic reference (author(s), year, title, and, if possible, DOI or link) that can be searched online. Do not fabricate references.  
• **Content-based definition**: Provide a real, verifiable observation directly grounded in the specific code content.  
• **Logic-based definition**: Provide a real, verifiable reasoning or practical point showing how retaining/removing this code could affect efficiency, clarity, or memory in annotation.

  },

    "Reasoning": "One or two sentences explaining practical or logical implications.",
    "Impact": "One sentence describing how this affects efficiency, clarity, or memory in annotation."
  }
}

<round 3>
# Introduce
This round follows a **two-layer reasoning mechanism — Self-Check** and **Cross-Discussion** — requiring structured reasoning and explicit stance decisions from your role’s perspective and positionality statement. Each role must use a **Decision Pattern** to clearly resolve **priority conflicts** (e.g., accuracy vs. efficiency).

# Task Description
## Self-Check
Re-examine your own stance to avoid blind persistence.

• **Explicit Stance**: Restate your Round-1 claim and decide whether to support, refute, or revise it.

• **Definition Consistency**: Justify your stance using only Round-2 definitions (literature, text, or logic cited previously).

• **Limitations & Decision**: Identify weaknesses in your reasoning and end decisively with “Continue to Support” or “Refute My Initial Claim.”
➡️ Follow **“First – Then – Finally”** reasoning structure.

## Cross-Discussion
Analyze and compare all other roles’ Round-1 and Round-2 claims.

• Per-Role Analysis: For each role, provide

		1. **Example**: The strongest defensible point.

	2. **Counterexample**: Specific flaw or contradiction (using Round-2 definition).

	3. **Summary**: Where your reasoning aligns or diverges.

• **Consensus / Divergence**: Summarize roles most aligned or conflicting with you.

• **Hybrid Perspective (optional)**: Combine textual grounding as primary and logical reasoning as secondary.
➡️ Follow **“Example – Counterexample – Summary”** structure.

<round 4>
# Introduce
This is **Round 4 (Final claim and explanation)**.  
In this round, each role must explicitly decide whether to **maintain, refute, or revise** their initial claim from Round 1.  
The decision must be grounded in the accumulated reasoning from **all roles' Round 1–3** (Claim, definition, Self-Check, Cross-discussion).  
The purpose is to reach a decisive and reflective conclusion, rather than re-argue. 
# Task Description
Should this disagree code be retained in the final data annotation?
## Final Claim and Explanation 
• Clearly restate your initial claim from Round 1.  
• Explicitly declare your current decision: *Continue to Support*, *Refute My Initial Claim*, or *Revise My Claim*.  
• Provide a short reasoning explanation (1 sentence) why you maintain or change your stance from your role's perspective and positionality statement.  
## Self-Reflection
• Strengths: Identify the strongest definition or logic that supported your decision.  
• Weaknesses: Acknowledge any limitations, contradictions, or unresolved issues.  
• Future Consideration: Indicate what further definition, clarification, or method would help strengthen or verify your stance.

  "Final Claim": "✅ Yes, the code "[code]" should be retained." Or "❌ No, the code "[code]" should not be retained.",
