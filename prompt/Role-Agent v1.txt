<role-agent task>
# Task Description
**From your assigned role and positionality**, use professional annotation reasoning to **extract 2–4 concise codes** representing the **central themes and intentions** in the target text.

• Target Text:
"[Target Text]"

# Requirements
## Definition of CODE
• Use only **concise labels (2–4 words)** to subjectively annotate the target text. • **Do not** include role names, job titles, or organizational references in the code label.
• Each code should describe an attribute or quality that **lacks a single objective ground truth** and therefore **depends on human judgment**.

## Mandatory definition
• For each code, **directly quote** from the Target Text — either a **full sentence** or a **key phrase (1–8 words)**.
• Enclose every quotation in **square brackets** [ ] for verification.
• **Do not** use placeholders such as [keyword]; always copy the **exact words** from the text (e.g., [The interface encourages user trust.]).
• Provide **1–3 justification sentences** (≤50 tokens each) using **discipline-specific vocabulary** where relevant.
• The **total output** must not exceed **450 tokens**.
